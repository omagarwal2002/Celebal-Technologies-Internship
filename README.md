# Human Action Recognition 

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Human Action Recognition using keypoints! This project is the result of my Celebal internship, where I aimed to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing human actions based on keypoints. The repository contains all the necessary code and files to replicate and explore the project.

# About this Repo
In this repository, you will find the following key files:

1. `app.py`: This file contains the code for the web application I created using Streamlit. The web app allows you to interactively test and visualize the model's action recognition capabilities.

2. `main.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook holds the code to train the ResNet50 deep learning model used in this project. You can refer to this notebook for details about the model's architecture and training process.

3. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the required libraries and dependencies to run the code successfully. Make sure to install them before running the code.

4. `resnet_model.h5`: This file stores the saved weights of the trained deep learning model. You can use this model to make predictions on new data or integrate it into other applications.

5. `resnet_pred.csv`: This CSV file contains the predictions made by the model on the test dataset. You can analyze these predictions and evaluate the model's performance.

# Dataset Used
For this project, I used the HAR dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains labeled keypoints of human actions, and you can find it here: [HAR Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/human-action-recognition-har-dataset). Make sure to credit the original dataset creators when using their data.

# Outputs
Here are some sample outputs of my model:

# My Web App
I have deployed a web application where you can try out my model interactively. You can access the web app through this link: [Human Action Recognition Web App](https://celebal-technologies-internship-mrpziagpwsv8diezfcjrqt.streamlit.app/). Have fun exploring the model's performance and its recognition capabilities!


Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the web app, and use the trained model for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
